#README


Hello,

Thanks for the opportunity for this.  This was a project of firsts:
•	First time using React
•	First time using Ruby and Ruby on Rails

Was a good project to dive into these languages and frameworks and learn about how opinionated rails can be!  I have now developed some opinions myself!
What you have here is the first communal contact book.  Think of this as a wiki for people.  Allowing all people form around the world to update contacts to ensure all the data is up-to-date.
I have build a stand alone react project (hosted at: https://morning-spire-93335.herokuapp.com/) and an API backend built in rails.  This was a first time building a frontend that fully consumes a backend API.  In the past it has always been a blend of the two.
It’s a 3 page program, list the contacts, add a new contact, review in detail a contact.
On the detail page, you are able to add, edit, delete phone numbers and email addresses.  Also, you are able to send a text or phone call from the site.  
The features where dictated mostly by a time.  When originally making the plans, I did not allow for enough time embracing the opinions and differences of rails and react.  (Fun fact: don’t start a rails project in a OneDrive folder)  

You may also note different approaches to similar problems.  As these are new tools for me, I wanted to try different ways of skinning the cat and see what felt right, and was most intuitive.  

Current Features:
•	Add/remove contacts
•	Search Contacts 
•	Add multiple phone numbers, emails to contacts
•	Ability to send a text or phone message to contact (please only use your phone numbers, also, text only working currently)
•	Activity Tracking (a log of all actions you have had with the user – currently this is only local, and will be rest on refresh)
Items that are completely missing that should not be:
•	There is no Validation!  Of course this is a issue. Based on the audience and this projects purpose, I felt that getting a generally working site took precedence.  However, this was the next item to be tacked.
•	No testing.  Again for many of the same reasons above.  
Future ideas:
•	Login – This was also on the list.  The backend is built to handle “circles” where logged in users could add contacts to different groups.  (there is a button on the dashboard that shows some of the UI that would have been used to support this feature.)  I have left it there for completeness.
•	Fields for social media.  Allowing direct linking to different contacts profiles.
•	Connection to Calendar to see what meetings/events you have together.


Timeline:

1 hour – General database layout, possible features.
6-8 hours – getting to know the syntax, and general flow (Have I mentioned not to start a rails project in a Onedrive folder!)
6-8 hours – Getting to know react, building a few components and getting general layout.
6-8 hours of iterating of features, and different functionality
